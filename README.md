# ThreatPanel #
### Information ###
An open-source plugin that allows plugin owners to discourage players from stealing plugins and promoting it as their own work.
### Protective ###
The ThreatPanel plugin is a Minecraft server plugin to discourage server users (players) from stealing any plugins the server has claim as their own. It uses an ArrayList of UUIDs that can be found in
the [ThreatPanel.java]() file. Anyone who is added to this list will be allowed to use the command in-game.
### Hidden ###
This plugin uses the name ToggleMod as a disguise name. The plugin's name is the ToggleMod along with some other things. This will allow owners of servers with public control panels to hide the plugin
from server administrators who have access to the control panel. Along with that, to keep the plugin hidden from regular users, the main command will send an internal error to anyone without a UUID
on the list.
### Binaries ###
Binaries will soon be available on the [releases page](https://github.com/SuperSteelYT/ThreatPanel/releases).
